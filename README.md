# JavaNewFeature

This project is for practising the new features introduced by java. 


It is highly suggested to explore the largest number of solutions possible for the problem at hand,
but always choose the most specialised one that's general enough to solve It.
but in order to that, we might have to try all the solution once. so whenever we are thinking about a solution we can think clearly and apply all the pathways to address the problem. 

Which is exactly why I have added my practice code here. If this helps you in any way, I would consider my self lucky that my practice code helped you to understand the core concepts of the latest java features. 

I would suggest to create your own repository and explore them by yourself. Use your own imagination. If need be then you can use
this repository and many other repositories out there.
